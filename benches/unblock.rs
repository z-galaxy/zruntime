//! What handing a piece of blocking work to `unblock` costs, and awaiting its outcome: the work
//! itself is a value handed back at once, so that all there is to time is the way there and back.
//! `unblock` needs no runtime, so every id awaits its futures with futures-lite's `block_on`, which
//! parks the thread that awaits until the work wakes it.
//!
//! `round-trip` times one `unblock` and the `block_on` that awaits it: the cost of a lone file
//! read or host-name lookup moved off the thread of a task, beyond that of the work. It is mostly
//! that of waking two threads, each parked as it waits for the other: the thread of the pool that
//! waits for work, and then the thread that awaits the outcome. The threads of the pool outlast
//! the gap between two iterations, so the work goes to one that is waiting for it, rather than to
//! one started for it, as it would to a thread started for each piece of work.
//!
//! `burst/16` times sixteen `unblock`s handed over one after the other, and then awaited in the
//! order they were handed over: a burst of work, such as the lookups of a batch of host names, that
//! the pool runs side by side on as many of its threads as are free for it. The throughput is in
//! pieces of work.
