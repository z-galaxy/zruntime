//! What spawning a task costs: a hundred tasks spawned on the runtime and awaited, inside one
//! `zruntime::block_on`, the shape of a program that does all of its work inside one call. The
//! runtime handle the tasks are spawned on is taken once, in a `block_on` of its own, before the
//! group starts, as in `runtime.rs`, whose ids, unlike this one, wait on timers, sockets or
//! another thread, which only the clock can measure.
