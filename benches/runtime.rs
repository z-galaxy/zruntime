//! What the runtime costs: a timer, watching a socket, and bytes moved through the reactor's
//! readiness path, within one thread and across two. What spawning a task costs, which waits on no
//! timer, socket or other thread, and so needs no clock to measure, is in `spawn.rs`. These are
//! the runtime's share of
//! what a connection built on it costs: the ids mirror what zbus measures of its connections (a
//! connection's setup and teardown, a method call's round trip, a large body, a burst of
//! concurrent calls to a peer on another thread) with the protocol taken out.
//!
//! Each id times its operation inside one `zruntime::block_on`, the shape of a program that does
//! all of its work inside one call. The runtime handle a routine spawns tasks or timers on is
//! taken once, in a `block_on` of its own, before the group starts, so only the operation runs
//! inside the timed `block_on`; a `SharedRuntime` handle kept alive this way is also what a later
//! `block_on` on the same thread resolves to, rather than a fresh runtime.
//!
//! `io/roundtrip-among-256-idle` is `io/roundtrip` again, while the runtime watches 256 sockets
//! nothing is sent on, each with a task waiting to read from it: what a wait costs per watched
//! socket, which a poller that keeps what it watches in the kernel leaves out.
//!
//! The `timer` ids need nothing but the reactor's timers, so they run on every platform. The `io`
//! and `cross-thread` ids need a unix socket pair to give the reactor's readiness path something to
//! watch, so they are unix-only.
