//! What a `broadcast` channel costs per message: one `Sender::broadcast` followed by a
//! `Receiver::recv` on each of 1, 2, 4 and 8 receivers, driven on a single thread with
//! `futures_lite::future::block_on`. The channel has a capacity of one, so every message is
//! received by all receivers before the next one is sent. `broadcast` needs no runtime.
