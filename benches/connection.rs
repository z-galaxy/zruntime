//! What a D-Bus connection costs on this runtime, with the protocol taken out: its setup and
//! teardown, a method call's round trip, a large body, a signal, and a burst of 1000 concurrent
//! calls to a peer on another thread, over an in-process channel and over a unix socket pair.
//! These were zbus's connection benchmarks, whose cost is mostly the runtime's, and they keep
//! zbus's ids.
//!
//! Instead of zbus, which depends on this crate, a connection's traffic is recreated here: the
//! same tasks, wakes, timers and I/O. A connection writes framed messages through a writer behind
//! an async lock; a socket reader task routes each reply to the call waiting on its serial and
//! hands each call to an object server task, which spawns and detaches a task per call; every
//! call races its reply against a 30-second timeout, as a zbus method call does; building a pair
//! over a socket takes a handshake of two round trips, as zbus's peer-to-peer one does; and
//! shutting a connection down gracefully drops it and waits for it to be gone.
//!
//! Left out are D-Bus's marshalling (a message here is a small fixed header and a body of raw
//! bytes), the handshake's actual text, and match rules (a connection has one signal queue, and
//! only one subscriber is ever exercised).
//!
//! The socket transport and every id built on it are unix-only; `method-call/1000-concurrent-p2p`
//! needs only the in-process channel and runs everywhere.
