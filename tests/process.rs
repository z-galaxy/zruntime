//! A test of the child processes that fills the pool of threads that all blocking work shares, and
//! so is a binary of its own.
//!
//! The pool is the one `zruntime::unblock` hands work to, which `Unblock`, `fs` and the pipes of a
//! child on Windows use as well. The test holds every thread of it for as long as it needs, and any
//! other test in the same process that had blocking work to run would wait for it to let them go.
//! The unit tests of the crate are one binary, whose tests run side by side, so none of them can do
//! that. A file under `tests/` is a binary of its own, and Cargo runs the binaries one after
//! another, never side by side. This one holds the single test: a second would run beside it, and
//! wait behind the pool that it fills.

/// The waits for children have a pool of their own, so none of them waits for a thread of
