/// on the runtime's timer rather than in the kernel: it keeps trying for as long as the backlog
/// stays full, and only whoever is awaiting this call bounds how long that is, through their own
/// timeout or by dropping the future. FreeBSD and macOS refuse a connection to a full listener with
/// `ECONNREFUSED` at once, blocking or not, so there is nothing to wait for, and the first

/// arrives here as [`io::ErrorKind::NotConnected`] — is the mark of one still under way, and
/// `SO_ERROR` holds the reason for one that failed. Winsock names the peer from the moment a
/// connect is issued, so there the peer is evidence of nothing; what is, is a zero-timeout
/// `select`, which puts the socket in `writefds` once the connection is made and in `exceptfds`
/// once it has failed, and in neither while it is still under way.
///
/// A unix connection can settle in between the two questions. One that fails there leaves its
/// reason in `SO_ERROR` after the first question found none, and leaves the socket with no peer
/// for the second: Linux and FreeBSD say so with `ENOTCONN`, but macOS answers `getpeername` on a
/// socket that can neither send nor receive any more, as a refused one cannot, with `EINVAL`. So
/// a `getpeername` that fails any other way than `ENOTCONN` sends the question back to
/// `SO_ERROR`, which holds the reason by then.
///
/// On either platform, a connection still under way is reported as a would-block, which is what
/// makes the wait a readiness wait like any other. Asked before the socket is known to be ready, as
/// the registration's first attempt asks it, it says the connection is still under way and the
/// caller waits; asked once the kernel has reported writability — which it does as soon as it is
/// done with the connection, whichever way that went — it finds the settled answer.
