//! Tests of [`Async`], the async handle of any source a runtime watches: over loopback sockets,
//! which every platform has, and, on unix, over pipes, unix-domain sockets and the standard I/O of
//! a child process.
//!
//! Most of the tests run in both flavours of runtime, through [`in_both_modes`], since a handle
//! means the same on either; the ones that only mean something in one — a source that is neither
//! `Send` nor `Sync`, which only a local runtime takes, and a thread that drives a runtime while
//! another gives up its source, which only a shared runtime has — are written for that flavour
//! alone.
//!
//! The first tests are of making a handle: that `new` puts its source in non-blocking mode and
//! `new_nonblocking` leaves the mode as it was. Then come the tests of `read_with` and
//! `write_with`: that they carry bytes between two handles, wait for room as well as for bytes,
//! make an interrupted call again at once and hand any other error back. After them come the
//! tests of what a wait does: that any number of tasks read from one handle or wait for its
//! readiness at once, that `readable` and `writable` wait for the right direction, and that a wait
//! given up leaves the others alone. The tests of the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits follow,
//! through the handle and through a reference to it, then those of `into_inner`, of the kinds of
//! source a handle takes, and last, of the handle's `Debug`, descriptors and auto traits.
