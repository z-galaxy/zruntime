//! Tests of [`Barrier`], which makes tasks wait for each other.
//!
//! Most of these drive the `wait` futures of a barrier by hand, polling each with a waker that goes
//! nowhere, so that every test says exactly who a trip releases and who still waits. They come
//! first: that the tasks of a round wait until the last has arrived and are then released together,
//! with the task whose arrival completes the round as its leader and nobody else; that the barrier
//! serves round after round, and that a task released by one round is not held by the next; what a
//! barrier made for no tasks or for one does; and that a `wait` future arrives when it is first
//! polled, not when it is made. Then come what giving up a wait leaves behind, which is the
//! arrival taken back unless its round was completed already, what a trip does to the wakers of the
//! tasks that wait, and how a barrier and its results print.
//!
//! The last two drive one barrier from threads. The first has several threads meet over many
//! rounds, and checks that each round has exactly one leader and that no thread leaves a round
//! before the last has arrived, nor gets more than a round ahead of the others; the second that a
//! trip racing the start of a wait is not missed. Both are shrunk under Miri, which runs them far
//! more slowly.
