//! Tests of [`OnceCell`], a cell that is set once and whose value tasks can wait for.
//!
//! Most of these drive the futures of a cell by hand, polling each with a waker that goes nowhere,
//! and hold an initialiser in the middle of its work with a future that stays pending until the
//! test opens a gate, so that every test says exactly who has the value and who still waits. They
//! come first: that `get` finds a value only once one is set; that `get_or_init` runs its closure
//! once, and that an initialiser that comes while another runs waits for it and gets its value;
//! what an initialiser that fails, is given up or panics leaves behind, which is an empty cell and
//! the next initialiser in line running its own closure; what `wait` waits for, and that it goes on
//! waiting through initialisers that fail or are given up; and that `set` waits for an initialiser
//! that runs, and fails or succeeds as that initialiser does, where no other initialiser is in
//! line. Then come what a value does to the wakers of the tasks that wait for it, which are those
//! of `wait`, of the initialisers that wait their turn and of `set`, the last two let out all
//! together rather than one behind the other, and the smaller conveniences (borrowing the value,
//! taking it back, making a cell, printing it).
//!
//! The last three drive cells from many threads at once. The first has threads ask for the value of
//! one cell together and checks that one initialiser runs and every thread gets its value; the
//! second that threads waiting for a value are all released by the one that initialises it; the
//! third that a value set racing the start of a wait is not missed. All three are shrunk under
//! Miri, which runs them far more slowly.
