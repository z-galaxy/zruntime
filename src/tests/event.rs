//! Tests of an [`Event`] and its listeners.
//!
//! Most of these drive listeners by hand, polling them with a waker that goes nowhere or with one
//! that counts its wakes, so that each says exactly which listener a notification reached and
//! which task it woke. A few poll with a waker built on a vtable of their own, which counts the
//! clones of the waker as well, or notifies the event from inside a clone: a waker built on
//! [`Wake`] is cloned by the standard library, where no test can see it. That vtable is the one
//! piece of `unsafe` code here, and the library has none of its own. They come in the order of what
//! they pin down: that a listener is queued as it is taken, that nothing is kept for one taken
//! later, the order listeners are notified in, what each kind of notification counts, what a
//! notified listener does when polled or dropped, what outlives what, which wakers are kept, and
//! that a waker may come back into the event it was woken or dropped by.
//!
//! The last few drive one event from many threads at once — through a lock built on it, through
//! listeners that give up the moment a notification reaches them, through wakers that come back
//! into it — and check that no notification is lost on the way and that nothing deadlocks. They
//! are shrunk under Miri, which runs them far more slowly.
