//! Tests of the pool of threads that blocking work runs on, each on a pool of its own, small enough
//! to fill, with an idle timeout chosen for the test.
//!
//! They hand the pool plain jobs that report back over channels: how the pool shares its threads
//! out among jobs is the same whatever the job, and the hand-over of an outcome that `unblock`
//! builds on it is tested in the module above. They come in the order of what they pin down: that a
//! thread that is done with a job takes up the next rather than the pool starting one for it, that
//! jobs that can only finish together each get a thread, that past its cap the pool has a job wait
//! for a thread to be done with the one it runs, that a thread goes once it has waited for a job
//! for the idle timeout, and that a job that panics leaves its thread to the jobs after it.
//!
//! The pool settles whether to start a thread for a job before handing the job over returns, so a
//! test can count the threads right after. Where a test waits for a thread to go back to waiting
//! for a job, or to go, it looks at the count until it says so.
//!
//! Every test ends by waiting for the threads of its pool to go, which each does once it has waited
//! for a job for the idle timeout: Miri ends a program with an error if a thread other than the
//! main one is still running as the main one returns. So the idle timeout of a test is also what
//! the test waits out at its end, and it is short wherever no thread has to wait for a job in the
//! course of the test.
