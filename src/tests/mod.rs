//! Tests of a runtime as a whole, of the event that tasks wait for, of the broadcast and MPMC
//! channels and the locks built on that event, of blocking work run on a pool of threads and the
//! filesystem access built on it, of the sockets a runtime watches, and of the child processes it
//! spawns.
//!
//! What a runtime does on its own — spawn, join, cancel, time, watch and drive — is tested in
//! the `core` module, in both flavours wherever the test means the same in each. `AsyncIo`, the
//! async handle of any source a runtime watches, is tested in the `async_io` module, in both
//! flavours wherever the test means the same in each. An event and its listeners, which need no
//! runtime, are tested in the `event` module. What the type system is to rule out — a local
//! runtime's handles leaving their thread, a shared runtime taking a future or a source that could
//! not follow it to another, a lock or a channel handing its value or its messages to a thread
//! that could not own them, the future of blocking work doing the same with the value it resolves
//! to, and an adapter of a blocking handle with its handle — can only be shown by code that does
//! not compile, so it is shown here, by the doc tests of the items below. The broadcast channel,
//! the MPMC channel and the locks, built on the event, are tested in the `broadcast`, `mpmc` and
//! `lock` modules. Blocking work, which needs neither the runtime nor the event, is tested in the
//! `unblock` module, and the filesystem access of the `fs` module, built on it, in the `fs`
//! module. The sockets of the `net` module are tested in the `net` module, one family of them to a
//! module there, in both flavours wherever the test means the same in each. The child processes of
//! the `process` module, built on a runtime and on blocking work, are tested in the `process`
//! module, in both flavours wherever the test means the same in each.
//!
//! The runtime and the event are features of their own, and a build may have either without the
//! other. A test of the runtime that uses an event to know that something happened is built only
//! where both are. The broadcast channel, the MPMC channel and the locks are features of their own
//! as well, each built on the event and with no use of the runtime.
