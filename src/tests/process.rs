//! Tests of `zruntime::process`: spawning children on a runtime, writing to and reading from the
//! pipes to them, waiting for them, and letting go of them.
//!
//! The commands the tests run are the ones every platform has, run through a shell where they need
//! more than one program: `sh -c` on unix and `cmd /C` on Windows, with the script of each in the
//! shell's own words. What only a shell of unix does, or what only a unix system's pipes and
//! process table make observable, is tested on unix alone. Most of the tests run in both flavours
//! of runtime, through [`in_both_modes`], since a child means the same on either; the ones that
//! need a task are written for a shared runtime.
//!
//! The first tests are of the builder: that it forwards what it is given to the std command, that
//! it reads back whether it kills and whether it reaps a child that is dropped, that it turns a std
//! command into its own, and that what it was not told about a standard stream is decided afresh
//! each time the command runs. Then come the tests of the futures of a command, its output, its
//! status and its failure to spawn, and of the pipes: that a child's input, output and error go
//! through them, that a read that has to wait leaves the thread to the other tasks, that a write
//! that has to wait does, and that the output is read from both pipes at once. After them come the
//! tests of waiting for a child: its status closes the child's input, a status that is given up on
//! can be asked for again, and `try_status` and `kill` agree with it. Then come the pipes handed to
//! another child, what happens to a child that is dropped, whichever way its command said, a child
//! on a task of a shared runtime, and last, the `Debug` of what the module hands out.
