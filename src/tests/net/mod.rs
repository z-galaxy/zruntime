//! Tests of the sockets of [`crate::net`], one module per family of them, and what the families'
//! tests have in common.
//!
//! Most of the tests run in both flavours of runtime, through [`in_both_modes`], since a socket
//! means the same on either; the ones that only mean something in one — a stream that moves to
//! another thread, which only a shared one may do — are written for that flavour alone. The
//! helpers here build the situations several families' tests need: a delay that puts a call to
//! sleep before the thing it waits for happens, a count of how often a call is polled while it
//! waits, a loopback address to bind to, a port that refuses connections, and a listener that has
//! room for one connection only.
