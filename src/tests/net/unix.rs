//! Tests of [`UnixListener`], [`UnixStream`], [`UnixDatagram`] and [`Incoming`], over socket files
//! in directories made for the tests.
//!
//! Each test makes the socket files it needs in a directory of its own, which a guard removes when
//! the test is done, so that tests running side by side never meet. The ones that run in both
//! flavours go through [`in_both_modes`]; the ones that spawn tasks, or send a stream to another
//! thread, only mean something on a shared runtime and are written for that.
//!
//! The first tests are of making a connection: that a connection carries bytes both ways, that one
//! to a path with no socket behind it reports why, and that one the listener has no room for yet
//! is waited for. Then come the tests of the mode the sockets are in: that the stream a listener
//! accepts, the streams of a pair, and the sockets made from std's, never block the thread.
//! Closing and shutting down follow, with a write to a peer that has gone, then the ways of
//! sharing a stream and what a call that has to wait does: a write waits for room and a read for
//! bytes, without spinning, and giving up an `accept` loses no connection. After the tests of
//! `incoming` come those of the datagram sockets, a `send_to` that finds the receiver's queue full
//! among them, of a shared runtime's sockets crossing threads, serving tasks and having several of
//! them wait at once, and last, of the sockets' `Debug`, descriptors and auto traits.
