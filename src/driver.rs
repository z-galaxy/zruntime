//! Who runs a runtime with a seat: the thread inside a [`block_on`](crate::block_on), or a
//! helper thread where no such thread is there to do it.
//!
//! A shared runtime handed out by [`SharedRuntime::current`](crate::SharedRuntime::current), or
//! built on by the free `block_on`, comes out of one of the registries below, and has a seat. The
//! scheduler and the reactor are run by one thread at a time, the one in the driver's seat.
//! A thread that enters `block_on` takes the seat if it is free and keeps it until its future is
//! done: between two polls of that future it runs a batch of ready tasks and then waits on the
//! reactor, so a program that drives its work through `block_on` runs it on its own thread and
//! starts none. A thread that finds the seat taken parks instead, to be polled again when its
//! future is woken or the seat is freed.
//!
//! Work that outlives every `block_on` — a task, a registered source or a timer polled from some
//! other executor, or a task left running once `block_on` has returned — is run by a helper
//! thread, started where that work is found with nobody in the seat, and gone once nothing is
//! left to run, watch or time. A `block_on` that arrives while the helper is in the seat is given
//! it, the helper parking until that call leaves, so that a program calling `block_on` once per
//! operation runs each of them on its own thread rather than behind a thread of the runtime's
//! own.
//!
//! Which runtime a thread is in the seat of is written down in the one place every runtime keeps
//! that record, the marker [`set_driving`] writes, so that a wake on that thread spares itself the
//! write that would break a wait the thread is not in, and a `block_on` there is turned away.
