//! What a runtime is made of, and the loop that drives it on a thread inside `block_on`.
//!
//! A runtime is a scheduler, a reactor, and the half of it that other threads reach: the
//! [`Remote`], through which a task is queued to be polled and the thread driving the runtime is
//! woken inside its wait. The first two hold state of the runtime's own flavour, behind `Rc` and
//! `RefCell` or `Arc` and `Mutex`; the remote is reached from wakers, which may be woken on any
//! thread, and so is always of the second kind whatever the runtime's flavour.
//!
//! A runtime has no thread of its own. The thread inside [`Core::block_on`] drives it for as long
//! as it is inside the call: between two polls of its future it runs a batch of ready tasks and
//! then waits on the reactor, so what the runtime has to do is done on that thread. One thread at
//! a time drives a runtime, and a thread drives one runtime at a time; a thread-local marker of
//! which runtime a thread drives is what the two rules are checked against, and what spares a
//! wake on that very thread the write that would break a wait it is not in.
//!
//! A shared runtime with a seat, which the `helper` feature's registries hand out, is driven
//! through that seat instead (see the `driver` module), and writes the same marker as it does.
