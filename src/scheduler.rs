//! The tasks of one runtime, and the polling of those that are ready.
//!
//! A scheduler holds every task spawned on it and hands them out a batch at a time to be polled,
//! on whichever thread calls [`Scheduler::run_batch`]. It has no thread of its own: the thread
//! driving the runtime calls that method for as long as there is anything to run.
//!
//! Every task lives in a slot of the scheduler's own, under an id that is never handed out
//! again, and holds its future there while it waits. Waking a task, from any thread, puts its id
//! on the runtime's ready queue and breaks the wait of the thread driving the runtime, which is
//! how a thread waiting with nothing to do learns that it has a task to poll. The waker holds the
//! id rather than the task's future: a waker has to be `Send` and `Sync`, and the future need be
//! neither. A wake for a task that is already queued does nothing, so a task woken three times is
//! polled once; the task is marked unqueued right before it is polled, so a wake that arrives
//! during the poll queues it again. An id whose task has gone by the time it comes up is skipped.
//!
//! The waker is made once, as the task is spawned, and waits in the slot beside the future, both
//! taken out for a poll and put back after it. On a shared runtime it points at what the task and
//! its handle share, which is `Send` and `Sync` there, rather than at an allocation of its own: a
//! spawn that allocates twice rather than three times is most of what spawning costs.
//!
//! [`spawn`] hands back a handle that resolves to what the task produced. The task's future is
//! wrapped before it is stored, and the wrapper is what hands the outcome over: the future's
//! output, or an error where it panicked, or — through a guard it holds, as it is dropped
//! unfinished — an error where the runtime went away with it or the task was cancelled. Whichever
//! it is, it is handed over once the future has been dropped. Dropping the handle cancels the
//! task: the future is dropped there and then if nobody is polling it, and by the poll under way
//! otherwise. A handle can also cancel the task and stay, to learn when the future is gone: the
//! future is dropped just as for a drop of the handle, but the outcome is left for the wrapper to
//! hand over, which tells the handle that the future is gone, and hands it the output where the
//! task had finished first. A task whose outcome is of no further interest is detached instead,
//! and runs until it ends.
//!
//! A task that panics takes nothing with it. The panic is caught where the task is polled, the
//! task ends there, its handle reports the failure, and the thread that polled it carries on
//! with the next task.
//!
//! No lock is held while a future is polled or dropped, nor while a waker is woken or dropped,
//! because all of these run code that may spawn a task, cancel one or wake another on this very
//! scheduler — the destructor of a future is where its last piece of work is handed off — and
//! that code takes the locks that would be held. On a local runtime the locks are `RefCell`s, and
//! the same rule is what keeps a borrow from ever finding another one out. The table of tasks and
//! the outcome a handle waits on each have a lock of their own, and neither is ever taken while
//! the other is held.
