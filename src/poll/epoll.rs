//! The wait on Linux and Android: epoll, which keeps what it watches in the kernel, and a pipe that
//! breaks the wait.
//!
//! The kernel holds every source watched in a direction, in the directions it was last told to
//! watch it in, and sees each change as it is made. A wait hands nothing over and asks only for
//! the sources the kernel found ready, so that it costs what those cost, however many more are
//! watched. The read end of the pipe is watched beside them, under a token of its own.
//!
//! A source is added to the epoll instance as it gains its first direction, and deleted from it as
//! it loses its last. epoll reports an error or a hang-up of a descriptor whatever it watches it
//! for, so a source watched for nothing that hung up would end every wait at once if it were in
//! there; and a source nobody ever waits on costs no system call.
//!
//! epoll takes its own timeout in whole milliseconds, rounded up, which would have a timer fire up
//! to a millisecond late. A wait with a timeout sets a timerfd, which takes nanoseconds and which
//! the instance watches as well, and has epoll wait without one.
